# Network & Memory Forensics – DFIR Casework

This repository documents two hands-on digital forensics investigations:
network malware analysis and memory forensics of a malicious PDF attack.

## Case 1: Network Forensics 
- PCAP analysis using Wireshark and NetworkMiner
- Malware payload extraction from HTTP traffic
- Identification of TrickBot malware disguised as an image
- Command-and-Control (C2) infrastructure discovery using TLS certificate analysis
- Collection of Indicators of Compromise (IPs, ports, hashes)

## Case 2: Memory Forensics (Malicious PDF)
- Memory analysis using Volatility
- Detection of injected processes triggered by a malicious PDF
- Analysis of active sockets and suspicious external connections
- Identification of banking malware behaviour (Zbot/Zeus)

## Tools & Techniques
- Wireshark
- NetworkMiner
- Volatility
- Kali Linux

## Disclaimer
All scenarios are **academic and simulated**.
No real systems, users, or organisations were involved.
